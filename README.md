# To-Do List Application

## Overview
This is a simple To-Do list web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. It is a basic example of how to manage user input and update the DOM dynamically.

## Features
- Add tasks to the to-do list
- Mark tasks as complete (strike-through effect)
- Delete tasks from the list
- Persist tasks using localStorage (tasks remain saved even if the page is refreshed)
- Clear all completed tasks button

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used to structure the layout and elements of the to-do list.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the app, including the task list, buttons, and interactive elements.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. It also interacts with localStorage to persist tasks.

## How to Use
1. **Add a Task**: Type the task into the input field and press Enter or click the "Add" button.
2. **Mark a Task as Complete**: Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as complete. The task will be crossed out.
3. **Delete a Task**: Click the "Delete" button next to any task to remove it from the list.
4. **Clear Completed Tasks**: Click the "Clear Completed" button to delete all tasks marked as completed.
5. **Refresh**: Your tasks will remain in the list even after refreshing the page thanks to localStorage.
